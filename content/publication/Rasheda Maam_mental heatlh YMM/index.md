abstract = "*Objective:*To investigate the patterns and the determinants of mental health service use by children and ado-lescents in Australia.

*Method:*Data from Young Minds Matter (YMM): The Second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of MentalHealth and Wellbeing is used in this study. YMM is a face-to-face household survey conducted in 2013-2014 thatcollected information from 6310 parents/carers of children aged 4-17 years (55% of eligible households). A self-reported survey of 2967 (89% of eligible youth) 11- to 17-year-olds from these households was also conducted.Bivariate analyses are used in this study to examine the variables and their distributions over the outcomevariables. Binary logit models are used to investigate the determinants of mental health service use.

*Results:*Parent reported data shows that among children aged 4-17 years, 12%, 1.2% and 0.6% utilised healthservices, school services and telephone services, respectively. Youth reported data reveals that approximately7.2%, 2% and 4% and 23.5% of children aged 11-17 years used health services, school services, telephoneservices and online services, respectively. Youth reported data further shows that online services were the mostpopular type of mental health service among adolescents. Those with anxiety or ADHD constituted the highestproportion of children that used any type of mental health services. Logistic analysis of parent reported datashows that children from step, blended and sole-parent households compared to original parent households weremore likely to use any type of mental health service, and the same trend was seen for children living in innerregional areas compared to those living in major cities. Children of parents with lower education or unemployedparents were also more likely to utilise health services.

*Conclusion:*From thefindings, it is concluded that age-relevant mental health services should be improved andmade available for children and adolescents. Secondly, school and health services should have a particular focuson complex disorders like ADHD, anxiety and conduct disorders, as these are the services most used by childrenwho suffer from these conditions. Finally, areas of low socio-economic status should focus on improving theirschool and health services as these are the services used most by children from these backgrounds."
